#️⃣ Assignment 2
🅐 PART A – Object-Oriented Programming Concepts
✅ 1. OOP in Python — Flexibility vs. Strict OOP

Explains why Python is loosely OOP compared to Java/C++.
Includes code for:

Inheritance

Encapsulation (getter/setter)

✅ 2. Polymorphism – Ride Sharing Fare System

Implements a polymorphic calculate_fare() for:

Auto

Bike

Sedan

Demonstrates why polymorphism replaces multiple if-else cases.

✅ 3. Hospital Staff Management (Inheritance)

A base class Staff with child classes:

Doctor

Nurse

Surgeon

Lab Technician
Each has unique behavior.

✅ 4. Banking System – Encapsulation

Implements:

Private variables (__balance, __pin)

Getter/setter

Secure access control

✅ 5. University Grading System – Encapsulation + Theory

Shows how marks, medical leaves, disciplinary records remain protected.
Uses private attributes and controlled access.

✅ 6. Online Payment System – Abstraction

Explains abstraction using–
✔ ABC module
✔ abstractmethod
✔ UPI, Credit Card, Net Banking implementations
Hides security logic from user.
